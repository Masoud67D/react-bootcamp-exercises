  title: "How to Tell If You're Being Tracked by Apple's AirTags",
  description: "AirTags aren’t a thing yet—at least, not when we wrote this—but the oft-rumored tracking devices, about the size of a coin, should debut soon. And when they do, Apple is already building security features into iOS 14.5 to prevent people from secretly tracking you by attaching a tiny tracker to your stuff (or dropping it in a bag, or however else some Mission Impossible wannabe might go about their spy games).",

  title: "Apple releases iOS 14.4.1 and macOS 11.2.3 to address a WebKit vulnerability",
  description: "Apple has released a set of updates it recommends all iPhone, iPad and Mac users download as soon as possible. No, iOS 14.5 and Big Sur 11.3 aren’t out yet. Instead, what we have are iOS 14.4.1 and macOS 11.2.3. When you download them on your devices, all you’ll get is a terse explanation from Apple saying that they’re “important.” However, the support pages spotted by 9to5Mac provide more information. Both updates address a memory corruption issue within WebKit, the engine that powers Apple’s Safari browser. The vulnerability, which was discovered by security researchers from Google and Microsoft, may have allowed bad actors to execute code on your devices using “maliciously crafted” web content.",

  title: "Arlo’s Video Doorbell and Pro 3 cameras helped me survive suburbia",
  description: "Soon after moving to a house in the Atlanta metro area last year, I knew I needed a video doorbell. UPS and FedEx would often drop boxes off and never alert me (not great when package thieves are everywhere!). Plus, sales people had the gall to ring my doorbell, unmasked and oblivious to the global pandemic. And if I was playing with my toddler in the backyard or working in the basement, I had trouble hearing if someone was at my door. A video doorbell would solve all of those issues, and give my family a little peace of mind to boot.",

  title: "Gatorade made a sweat patch to track your perspiration",
  description: "You sweat, I sweat, everybody sweats. But everyone perspires differently — whether it’s the amount you produce or what comes out of your glands. The composition of your sweat can tell you a lot about what your body needs to recover after a workout. That’s the idea behind Gatorade’s new Gx Sweat Patch anyway. The patches come in packs of two for $25, and you scan them for results using the iPhone app (sorry, Android users).",

  title: "Big Tech Targets DC With a Digital Charm Offensive",
  description: "DID YOU KNOW Facebook supports updated internet regulations? I know that. Boy, do I know it. I’m guessing everyone else who lives in the Washington, DC, area knows it too. For at least the past five weeks, Facebook has been deluging the region with ads declaring its support for regulation. I originally noticed when my morning ritual of watching basketball highlights on NBA.com started getting disrupted by the same 30-second message from Facebook every single time I wanted to watch a 3-minute video. Just let me see the slam dunks, please!",

  description: "You may assume that you have to rely on Google, Apple or Microsoft for fast and free email, but that’s not true. If you want to break away from the big tech giants, there are other options. One of those is ProtonMail. Many Gizmodo staffers rely on Gmail, but some of us also use ProtonMail, and we think it’s worth highlighting this lesser-known service. ProtonMail may lack the polish of its rivals, but it does have some advantages.",

While Apple has certainly made its mark, iOS is really a niche operating system.

Learning to develop Android apps is easier than you may think. All you need is the right training — like this Android 11 Developer Bundle led by coding experts Mashrur Hossain and Meisam Mansourzadeh.",
